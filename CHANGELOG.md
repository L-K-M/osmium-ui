# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Import the Mac OS 8 appearance kit from Finsical as Osmium UI: document
  windows with titlebar boxes, pinstripes, grow box and windowshade, plus
  the full control set, pixel-faithful in HTML and CSS.
- Ship the classic behaviour: mouse tracking, default-button pulses, and
  the rest of the interaction model from Mac OS 8.
- Add `osmium.css` with the one-window page layout and the demo pages:
  desktop, controls, Finder list view, control panel and About window.
- Add the Swift package (`macos/OsmiumWindows.swift`) wrapping the web UI
  for WKWebView apps, and a demo macOS app.
- Add pixel fonts (Geneva 9/10, Charcoal 12) as TypeScript data.
- Add CI (web checks on Ubuntu, SwiftPM compile and demo build on macOS).
